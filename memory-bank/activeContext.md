# Active Context: Apex Insights Web

## Current Focus

Implemented visual enhancements for the "AI Agent Readiness & Strategy Workshop" landing page (`src/app/ai-agent-workshop/page.tsx`), including a new Hero section, improved card styling, and a countdown timer component (`src/components/ui/countdown-timer.tsx`). The page now requires specific content population (agenda details, bios, CTA links, countdown date). Focus can shift to populating this content or tackling other pending tasks.

## Recent Changes/Decisions

*   Created the initial AI Agent Workshop landing page.
*   Manually added the `Avatar` component (`src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`) due to build issues.
*   Created the `CountdownTimer` client component (`src/components/ui/countdown-timer.tsx`).
*   Enhanced the visual design of the AI Agent Workshop page (Hero, cards, countdown timer, icons).
*   Updated `task.md` and `progress.md`.

## Immediate Next Steps

*   Task 1: Define specifics for testimonial card modifications (Details needed).
*   Task 3: Plan structure/implementation for the blog section (Consider content source/management).
*   Task 4: Gather social media links and identify placement locations.
*   Task 5: Identify files needing marketing copy updates.
*   Task 11: Populate AI Agent Workshop page with real content (agenda, bios, links, countdown date).
