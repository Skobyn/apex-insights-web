# Project Progress: Apex Insights Web

## Overall Status

The website is live at getapexinsights.com. Work is ongoing to add new features and content. The AI Agent Workshop landing page structure is complete, and visual enhancements (Hero, cards, countdown) have been implemented.

## What Works?

*   Core website structure and pages are deployed and functional.
*   Displays services, testimonials (currently in `testimonials-section.tsx`).
*   Likely includes contact/booking functionality.
*   Built with Next.js, React, Tailwind, Shadcn/ui.
*   AI Agent Workshop landing page (`src/app/ai-agent-workshop/page.tsx`) created with enhanced visuals (Hero, styled cards, icons).
*   `Avatar` component (`src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`) available.
*   `CountdownTimer` component (`src/components/ui/countdown-timer.tsx`) available and integrated (with placeholder date).

## What's Left / In Progress?

*   Populating the AI Agent Workshop landing page with specific content (agenda details, consultant bios, CTA links, real countdown date).
*   Adding subsequent new landing pages.
*   Modifying the existing testimonial/review card component.
*   Updating general marketing copy/materials on the site.
*   Adding a blog section and posting content.
*   Adding links to social media profiles.
*   Implementing a robust content management strategy (if needed for blogs/landing pages).

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   Need to define the specific structure and content for new landing pages (beyond the first one).
*   Need details on the required modifications for the testimonial cards.
*   Need the specific social media links and desired locations.
*   AI Agent Workshop page requires specific details (agenda, bios, links, countdown date) to be finalized.
