# Project Progress: Apex Insights Web

## Overall Status

The website is live at getapexinsights.com. Work is ongoing to add new features and content. Two new landing pages (AI Agent Workshop, Gemini BI Quickstart) have been created with enhanced visual structure.

## What Works?

*   Core website structure and pages are deployed and functional.
*   Displays services, testimonials (currently in `testimonials-section.tsx`).
*   Likely includes contact/booking functionality.
*   Built with Next.js, React, Tailwind, Shadcn/ui.
*   AI Agent Workshop landing page (`src/app/ai-agent-workshop/page.tsx`) created with enhanced visuals.
*   Gemini BI Quickstart landing page (`src/app/gemini-bi-quickstart/page.tsx`) created with enhanced visuals.
*   `Avatar` component (`src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`) available.
*   `CountdownTimer` component (`src/components/ui/countdown-timer.tsx`) available.

## What's Left / In Progress?

*   Populating the AI Agent Workshop landing page with specific content (agenda details, consultant bios, CTA links, real countdown date).
*   Populating the Gemini BI Quickstart landing page with specific content (CTA links, etc.).
*   Adding subsequent new landing pages (if any more planned).
*   Modifying the existing testimonial/review card component.
*   Updating general marketing copy/materials on the site.
*   Adding a blog section and posting content.
*   Adding links to social media profiles.
*   Implementing a robust content management strategy (if needed for blogs/landing pages).

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   Need to define the specific structure and content for new landing pages (beyond the first two).
*   Need details on the required modifications for the testimonial cards.
*   Need the specific social media links and desired locations.
*   Both new landing pages require specific details (links, dates, bios) to be finalized.
