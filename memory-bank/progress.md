*   Displays services, testimonials (currently in `testimonials-section.tsx`).
*   Likely includes contact/booking functionality (e.g., Calendly integration seen in `package.json`).
*   Built with Next.js, React, Tailwind, Shadcn/ui.
*   Initial version of the AI Agent Workshop landing page created at `src/app/ai-agent-workshop/page.tsx`.

## What's Left / In Progress?

*   Refining the AI Agent Workshop landing page (adding specific content, bios, CTA links).
*   Adding subsequent new landing pages.
*   Modifying the existing testimonial/review card component.
*   Updating general marketing copy/materials on the site.
*   Adding a blog section and posting content.

*   Need the specific social media links and desired locations.
*   AI Agent Workshop page requires specific details (agenda, bios, links).
