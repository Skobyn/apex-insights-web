**In Progress:**

- General marketing copy and site improvements

**Completed:**
- Updated Memory Bank and documentation to reflect new direction

## Overall Status

The website is live at getapexinsights.com. Three new landing pages (AI Agent Workshop, Gemini BI Quickstart, Workspace AI Boost) have been created with an enhanced visual structure, ready for final content population. Added a new "Owners" page with a Google Dialogflow chatbot integration for SMB Tax assistance.

## What Works?

*   Core website structure and pages are deployed and functional.
*   Displays services, testimonials (currently in `testimonials-section.tsx`).
*   Likely includes contact/booking functionality.
*   Built with Next.js, React, Tailwind, Shadcn/ui.
*   AI Agent Workshop landing page (`src/app/ai-agent-workshop/page.tsx`) created with enhanced visuals.
*   Gemini BI Quickstart landing page (`src/app/gemini-bi-quickstart/page.tsx`) created with enhanced visuals.
*   Workspace AI Boost landing page (`src/app/workspace-ai-boost/page.tsx`) created with enhanced visuals.
*   `Avatar` component (`src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`) available.
*   `CountdownTimer` component (`src/components/ui/countdown-timer.tsx`) available.
*   Owners page (`src/app/owners/page.tsx`) created with Google Dialogflow chatbot integration.

## What's Left / In Progress?

*   Populating the AI Agent Workshop landing page with specific content (agenda, bios, links, countdown date).
*   Populating the Gemini BI Quickstart landing page with specific content (links, etc.).
*   Populating the Workspace AI Boost landing page with specific content (pricing, links, etc.).
*   Adding subsequent new landing pages (if any more planned).
*   Modifying the existing testimonial/review card component.
*   Updating general marketing copy/materials on the site.
*   Adding a blog section and posting content.
*   Adding links to social media profiles.
*   Implementing a robust content management strategy (if needed for blogs/landing pages).
*   Consider adding the Owners page to the navigation menu in the Header component.

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   Need to define the specific structure and content for new landing pages (beyond the three created).
*   Need details on the required modifications for the testimonial cards.
*   Need the specific social media links and desired locations.
*   All three new landing pages require specific details (links, dates, bios, pricing) to be finalized.
